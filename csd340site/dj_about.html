		<h1>About</h1>

		<p >Douglas M. Bross Jr., or as he is known by many DJ. Is a young student currently attending
		classes at Eastern Kentucky University. When he was young, he had a strong desire to become an
		engineer, aiming to become a software engineer in particular. He also enjoyed the arts, with another
		thought floating around to become an Art major. Once he entered college, he found programming to be
		fun and tried for a degree in Software Engineering. However, once he began his courses, he was plagued
		with issues. He had trouble understanding some of the content needed to become a software engineer,
		and both his teachers and a lack of tutors for his program, led him to follow another dream of his, one
		that he now follows prouder than ever.</p>

		<p>He is now studying Graphic Design and is enjoying his classes
		much more than before. He has a simple hope for when he graduates, or even before. He wishes to do
		something meaningful, whether that be for the world, or simply for a client. Heâ€™s also hopeful to make
		many friends along the way, which he feels will be an easy task. On a smaller scale, he is also hopeful
		that he will be able to design book covers. </p>
